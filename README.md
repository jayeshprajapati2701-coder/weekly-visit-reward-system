This project is a QR-based customer loyalty and reward management system designed for fast food stalls, hotels, and small retail shops. The main goal of this system is to increase customer retention and keep customers happy by rewarding regular visits with free food or discounts.

In this system, each shop owner can register their shop and generate a unique QR code. Customers scan the QR code every time they make a purchase. Each scan marks the customer’s attendance and stores a transaction ID, ensuring that only genuine visits are counted.

The system automatically tracks customer visits on a weekly basis. If a customer visits the shop 6 days in a week, they become eligible for a free meal or reward on a fixed reward day decided by the shop owner. This creates motivation for customers to visit regularly and builds long-term loyalty.

Shop owners get a dashboard to:

View daily and weekly customer attendance

Identify regular customers

Manage free food or discount rewards

Customers can:

Scan QR codes easily

Track their weekly visits

Check reward eligibility

This project is ideal for local food businesses and small shops that want a simple, low-cost digital loyalty solution without complex hardware. It is also suitable as a college project, demonstrating real-world use of QR codes, databases, and customer loyalty logic.
